## 1. Installing VScode
Go to the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/, and follow the instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for all the major operating systems, like OSX (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs).

## 2. Remotely Connecting
## 3. Trying Some Commands
## 4. Moving Files with `scp`
## 5. Setting an SSH Key
## 6. Optimizing Remote Running

### I hope this tutorial helped in underestanding how to setup remote access and to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`.

# Thank you!
